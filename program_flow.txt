>If you ever get an index error pulling from the stack there are no valid options and search has exhausted the space
Check that all rows have options to pick
T> 	Assign a player match
	write that match to the stack
	write x80
	write nulled indices to stack
	increment player number

F> 	Pull changes from stack until you pull 0x8000
	decrement player number
	for every change write a 1 to that indice in the target matrix




every iteration through loop can do one of two options:
	make a match
	recognize that this is no longer a valid space and undo previous matches


current issue: what do we do if we need to move up to a previous player


when assigning a match
-write the match to the stack
-write n matches per column to stack
-write a zero to that match index
-zero out no longer valid options
-write them to stack
-write number of zerod out options to stack


when undoing a match
-pull how many indices were zerod
-pull that many indices off stack and make ones

what happens when we have to go up a branch?

Stack flow
0xX0Y0 	<-what decision was made for this branch
0x8000 	<-Divider for pulling from stack
0xRRCC	<-an indice that was zerod
0xRRCC
0xRRCC
0xRRCC
0xRRCC	<-divider for pulling from stack
---		in between this we've commited a match

	

what if used 16 bit numbers (allows for 128 players)
0b1[XXXXXXX]_[XXXXXXX]
where 0x8000 is used to denote a field separator between matches
