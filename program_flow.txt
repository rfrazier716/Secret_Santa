every iteration through loop can do one of two options:
	make a match
	recognize that this is no longer a valid space and undo previous matches


current issue: what do we do if we need to move up to a previous player


when assigning a match
-write the match to the stack
-write n matches per column to stack
-write a zero to that match index
-zero out no longer valid options
-write them to stack
-write number of zerod out options to stack


when undoing a match
-pull how many indices were zerod
-pull that many indices off stack and make ones

what happens when we have to go up a branch?

Stack Structure
|xy0|	match that was made
|x8 |
||	second attempted match that was made
||
|| <-- how many choices have been made with this row
||
||    indices of matrix that were zero'd
||
||
||
||
||
||
||	number of indices that were zero'd
